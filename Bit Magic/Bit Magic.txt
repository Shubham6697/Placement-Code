There are six operator we have ->
1. Bitwise AND operator (&)
2. Bitwise OR operator (|)
3. Bitwise NOT operator (~)
4. Bitwise XOR operator (^)
5. Bitwise Right Shift operator (>>)
6. Bitwise Left Shift operator (<<)

Note : The left shift and right shift operators should not be used for negative numbers.


Problem 1. Check the number whether even or odd

number & 1 == 0  ----->   even number
number & 1 == 1  ----->   odd number

Problem 2. Right Shift means we dividing the number in the power of 2.
Problem 3. Left Shift means we multipling the number in the power of 2.



















































The following are many other interesting problems using XOR operator.

1. Find the Missing Number  (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-missing-number/)
2. swap two numbers without using a temporary variable
3. A Memory Efficient Doubly Linked List
4. Find the two non-repeating elements.
5. Find the two numbers with odd occurences in an unsorted-array.
6. Add two numbers without using arithmetic operators.
7. Swap bits in a given number/.
8. Count number of bits to be flipped to convert a to b .
9. Find the element that appears once.
10. Detect if two integers have opposite signs.
